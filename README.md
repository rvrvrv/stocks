Stock Market App Project for FreeCodeCamp

**Live App**: https://rv-stocks.herokuapp.com

## User Stories
1. I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
2. I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
3. I can remove stocks.
4. I can see changes in real time when any other user adds or removes a stock. This is implemented via [socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io).
